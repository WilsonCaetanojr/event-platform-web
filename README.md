* [React](https://reactjs.org/)      
* [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/)      
* [GraphCMS](https://graphcms.com/)      
* [Apllo GraphQL](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/)      

# :rocket: Objective

The main objective of this project was to work with new tools, such as:
* Communicating with GraphQL
* Data caching with Apollo
* Styling with tailwindcss

The focus of this project was not field validations and access permission. So they weren't made.
